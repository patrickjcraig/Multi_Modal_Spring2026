# Multi_Modal_Spring2026

## Project Milestones
1.	Develop a modular data ingestion framework capable of handling multiple microscopy modalities such as X-ray, scanning acoustic microscopy, and optical imaging.
    a. Implement a CT algorithm for 3D data such as x-ray and model in opencv
  	b. Create a script to seperate non-image data (headers, tool settings) from image data for each modality
  	c. Add support for time-series data such as SAM using FFT methods
  	d.
2.	Implement spatial alignment methods to register datasets acquired at different resolutions and coordinate systems.
    a. 2D registration algorithm
  	b.
  	c.
  	d.
3.	Enable region-based analysis to support localization of defects across modalities
